# Arduino-Weather-Station
This provides the code and (some) hardware instructions to create a working Arduino Weather Station.

## Code
This code was done using Arduino Programming software (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) <-- using this
Libraries were installed ON the IDE (in tools). Use the names of the libraries at the top, including: LiquidCrystal_I2C, Wire.h, Zanshin_BME680, and DS1307RTC.

## Hardware
All hardware was Arduino hardware. The following were used: Arduino LCD, BME680 Weather Sensor, Arduino UNO board, Arduino (large) breadboard, jumper wires, buttons, and an RTC / real-time clock.
-- The hardware section will be updated later on --
